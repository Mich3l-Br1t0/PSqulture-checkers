# PSqulture-checkers
This game was developed for the hiring process of Qulture.Rocks. 
Since I didn't had much time to develop it, the code needs some improvements, the king movementation isn't 100%.
I was inspired by a series of videos of Tech With Tim https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim, one future improvement could be the implementation of an AI to play against. 
Well, this game should be played with 2 players, it's more fun, but you can play alone to test something or train your checkers skills.
The red pieces always do the first movement, the interface is simple, the winner is displayed on the console, one futute improvement could be to improve de game display, option to change colours and more. 
The algorithm behind the moves isn't much complicated, the piece checks all its diagonals to see if there's a possible movement and the displays to the player.
